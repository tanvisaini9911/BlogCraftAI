# Technical Branch Blueprints

This document outlines the learning paths and implementation expectations for each technical branch. Detailed curricula, resources, and assessment artifacts now live in the [`tracks/`](../tracks) directory—consult both the blueprint (strategy) and track package (execution) when initializing branches.

4. **Validation & Safety**
   - JSON schema validation for request/response payloads.
   - Guardrails for forbidden terms, profanity filters, and domain compliance.
   - Implement retry logic, timeout handling, and fallback prompts.
5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests with mocked model responses.
   - Negative tests for schema violations, forbidden terms, and timeout scenarios.
   - Load tests to measure throughput and concurrency limits.

### Deliverables
- Production-ready AI suggestion endpoint with safeguards.

   - Post list with pagination, category filters, and search.
   - Post detail with comment threads, inline comment creation (HTMX), and moderation cues.
4. **Editor Enhancements**
   - Rich text editor (TipTap/Quill) integrated with “Suggest SEO” button leveraging AI endpoint.
   - Draft autosave, version history, and preview mode.
5. **Resilience & Performance**
   - Lazy loading for images, caching strategies, and asset bundling.
   - Error states (offline mode, 404/500 pages) with friendly messaging.
6. **Testing & Accessibility**
   - Component/unit tests (Jest or Django test client), end-to-end tests (Playwright).
   - Accessibility audits with axe-core and Lighthouse (90+ scores).

### Deliverables
- Production-grade frontend aligned with UX best practices.
- Comprehensive Storybook or pattern library for shared components.
- Automated tests covering UI flows, accessibility, and responsiveness.
