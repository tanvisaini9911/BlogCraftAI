- Maintain a shared resource board where alumni can contribute tips, templates, and inspirational case studies.

## Risk Mitigation

- Have backup facilitators for key sessions in case of scheduling conflicts.
- Preload all templates and decks offline to handle connectivity issues.
- Offer recorded sessions and asynchronous options for participants in different time zones.
