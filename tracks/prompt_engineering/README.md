# Prompt Engineering & AI Integration Track

The Prompt Engineering branch guides learners through designing safe, reliable AI-assisted content workflows using open-source Hugging Face models. Participants build a `/api/ai/suggest` endpoint with schema validation, guardrails, and monitoring while mastering prompt design patterns.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Craft system, developer, and user prompts that align with BlogCraftAI tone and compliance requirements.
2. Evaluate and fine-tune open-source transformer models (Mistral-7B, Llama 3) for inference efficiency.
3. Implement a resilient AI suggestion API with retries, caching, and deterministic schema enforcement.
4. Apply guardrails to block forbidden terms, enforce content policies, and capture audit evidence.
5. Measure latency, throughput, and quality metrics; implement fallbacks to maintain SLAs.
6. Ship automated tests simulating network failures, model timeouts, and adversarial inputs.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the Django track or equivalent experience with Django REST Framework.
- Familiarity with Python async programming and queue-based architectures.
- Working knowledge of JSON schema and data validation libraries (pydantic, jsonschema).
- Awareness of responsible AI guidelines and content moderation practices.

## Documentation Map

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `curriculum.md` | Five-day agenda covering prompt theory, model operations, and API implementation. |
| `resources.md` | Tooling setup, model hosting strategies, and reference prompts. |
| `assessments.md` | Lab scoring guides, quality metrics, and test plan specifications. |
| `templates/` | Prompt playbooks, schema definitions, and incident response checklists. |

## Facilitation Tips

- Emphasize reproducibility; require learners to version prompts and evaluation datasets.
- Use red/blue team exercises to test guardrails and bias mitigation strategies.
- Encourage instrumentation-first development: log prompts, tokens, latency, and moderation events.
