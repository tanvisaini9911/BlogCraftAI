# Prompt Engineering Resources & Tooling

## Model Hosting Options

| Scenario | Recommendation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local development | `text-generation-inference` with quantized weights | Use GPU-equipped dev machine or provision on RunPod. |
| Team staging | Hugging Face TGI on Kubernetes | Autoscale workers, attach Prometheus exporter. |
| Production | Render.com service backed by GPUs or managed endpoint | Enforce network egress restrictions and audit logging. |

## Key Libraries

- **transformers** – core model loading and generation API.
- **accelerate** – device placement, multi-GPU coordination.
- **bitsandbytes** – quantization and memory optimization.
- **huggingface_hub** – model versioning, caching, offline support.
- **promptguard** / **guardrails-ai** – schema validation and guardrails DSL.
- **pydantic** – request/response validation for `/api/ai/suggest`.
- **tenacity** – retry/backoff utilities for robust inference calls.
- **httpx** – async HTTP client with timeout control.
- **prometheus-client** – instrumentation for latency, token usage, success rates.

## Prompt Assets

Store canonical prompts in version control under `prompts/` with metadata:

```yaml
id: seo_v1
role: system
objectives:
  - Maintain BlogCraftAI voice and guidelines.
  - Provide SEO keyword suggestions and meta description drafts.
constraints:
  - Avoid first-person pronouns.
  - Include call-to-action suggestions.

## Sample JSON Schema

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "SuggestResponse",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["title", "meta_description", "keywords"],
  "properties": {
    "title": {"type": "string", "minLength": 10, "maxLength": 80},
    "meta_description": {"type": "string", "minLength": 50, "maxLength": 160},
    "keywords": {
      "type": "array",
      "minItems": 5,
      "maxItems": 12,
      "items": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z0-9\- ]+$"}
    },
    "safety_flags": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["forbidden_term", "bias", "pii"]}
    }
  }
}
```

## Evaluation Dataset Template

| Draft ID | Input Summary | Target Audience | Desired Tone | Known Constraints | Expected Keywords |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BLOG-001 | "How to launch AI-assisted blogging" | Marketing leads | Energetic, authoritative | Avoid vendor lock-in claims | ai blogging, automation, content ops |
| BLOG-002 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Observability Dashboard Metrics

- Request count per endpoint / model version.
- Latency percentiles (P50/P95/P99) and timeout rate.
- Token usage (prompt vs. completion) per request.
- Guardrail triggers segmented by type (forbidden term, schema violation).
- User satisfaction score from human review workflows.

## Incident Response Runbook (excerpt)

1. **Detect** – Alert fires when timeout rate > 5% for 5 min.
2. **Triage** – Check model service health, GPU utilization, queue backlog.
3. **Mitigate** – Activate fallback lightweight model, throttle non-essential workloads.
4. **Communicate** – Notify #ai-ops channel, update status page.
5. **Root Cause Analysis** – Capture timeline, update guardrail/evaluation datasets.
