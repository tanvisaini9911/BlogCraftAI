# Frontend Experience Track

The Frontend branch teaches teams how to build an accessible, performant user interface for BlogCraftAI using Django Templates, Bootstrap 5, and HTMX. Learners deliver responsive pages for authentication, post browsing, detail views, comments, and an editor integrated with AI suggestions.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Implement reusable base templates with semantic HTML, ARIA support, and dark-mode friendly design tokens.
2. Build authentication flows (login, registration, password reset) with inline validation and accessible feedback.
3. Develop post list, detail, and comment interactions with HTMX partials, optimistic UI, and pagination.
4. Integrate the AI suggestion endpoint into the editor with robust error handling and fallback messaging.
5. Optimize frontend performance (lazy loading, caching, minification) to meet Lighthouse 90+ scores.
6. Create automated tests covering component behaviour, accessibility checks, and end-to-end user journeys.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript fundamentals.
- Familiarity with Django template inheritance and static file management.
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and asynchronous interactions (fetch, HTMX).
- Completion of the Django backend track or access to equivalent API endpoints.
