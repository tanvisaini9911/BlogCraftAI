# BlogCraftAI Integrated Assessments

## Release Gate Checklist

- [ ] All automated test suites (unit, integration, e2e, performance) green with coverage â‰¥ 90% across codebase.
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation published and validated; SDKs regenerated.
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-code applied successfully; drift detection run.
- [ ] Security scans (dependency, container, SAST, DAST) show no critical issues.
- [ ] Observability dashboards populated with baseline metrics.
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off captured (Product, Engineering, Operations, Compliance).

## Test Suites Overview

| Suite | Owner | Tooling | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | Backend + Frontend Teams | pytest, Jest | Business logic, components, utilities |
| Integration | Platform Team | pytest-django, respx, Celery integration | Cross-service workflows |
| E2E | QA Guild | Playwright, Cypress (mobile) | User journeys from login to publish |
| Performance | SRE | k6, Locust, Lighthouse CI | Load, concurrency, page performance |
| Security | Security Guild | bandit, safety, Snyk, OWASP ZAP | Vulnerability detection |
| Chaos | SRE + Platform | Gremlin/Litmus, custom scripts | Resilience and failover |

## SLO Monitoring Plan

- Define SLIs for availability, latency, error rates, and quality (SEO success, AI satisfaction score).
- Automate error budget burn alerts; escalate to incident commander.
- Weekly review of SLO dashboards; adjust remediation backlog accordingly.

## Incident Response Requirements

- 24/7 on-call rotation established with escalation paths.
- Runbooks for top 5 incident scenarios (AI outage, DB failover, cache saturation, CDN downtime, credential leak).
- Quarterly game days to test resilience and runbook accuracy.

## Capstone Demonstration Criteria

1. User logs in, drafts content, receives AI suggestions, publishes post.
2. Admin views analytics dashboards and moderates comments.
3. SEO health validated via Lighthouse + schema markup tests.
4. Deployment pipeline triggered from merge to `main`, resulting in staging deploy with automated smoke tests.
5. Incident simulated (AI service timeout) with clear UI fallback and recovery shown.

## Post-Launch Metrics Review

- Track content velocity, conversion metrics, and AI adoption rates.
- Monitor infrastructure cost vs. budget; implement auto-scaling policies if needed.
- Collect qualitative feedback from editorial team and incorporate into backlog.
