# BlogCraftAI Full-Stack Delivery Track

The BlogCraftAI branch integrates backend, frontend, AI, and operations disciplines into a production-ready platform. Learners orchestrate the complete stack—Django 5 + DRF, PostgreSQL, HTMX-driven templates, AI services, and deployment pipelines on Render.com—while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability, security, and observability.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Compose a modular Django project with cohesive app boundaries and shared domain services.
2. Integrate AI suggestion workflows into editorial experiences with robust fallbacks and telemetry.
3. Operate PostgreSQL and Redis infrastructure with migrations, backups, and connection pooling.
4. Deliver a responsive frontend aligned with accessibility, SEO, and performance benchmarks.
5. Implement CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and Render.com deployment with observability.
6. Establish governance: logging, alerting, runbooks, SLA/SLO measurement, and incident response.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Django, Prompt Engineering, and Frontend tracks or equivalent experience.
- Comfort with containerization, infrastructure-as-code, and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Working knowledge of security best practices (OWASP, Secrets management, IAM).

## Documentation Map

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `curriculum.md` | Cross-disciplinary agenda culminating in production launch. |
| `resources.md` | Consolidated tooling matrix, infrastructure diagrams, environment references. |
| `assessments.md` | End-to-end quality gates, SLO definitions, and release-readiness checklist. |
| `templates/` | Deployment playbooks, SLA docs, and runbook templates. |

## Facilitation Guidance

- Maintain tight integration cadence across subteams; enforce daily syncs and integration checkpoints.
- Use trunk-based development with feature flags to minimize merge friction.
- Conduct simulated incident drills to ensure operational readiness before go-live.
