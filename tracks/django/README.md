# Django Backend Specialization Track

The Django branch equips learners with the skills to architect a production-grade backend for BlogCraftAI using Django 5, Django REST Framework, and PostgreSQL. The curriculum emphasizes clean architecture, SOLID principles, and operational readiness so graduates can ship reliable services that power the wider platform.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this track participants will be able to:

1. Bootstrap a multi-app Django project (`accounts`, `blog`, `api`) with environment-specific settings and twelve-factor alignment.
2. Model relational data in PostgreSQL with migrations, constraints, and seed fixtures that enforce content governance.
3. Implement JWT-authenticated REST APIs with role-based permissions, throttling, and schema-first documentation.
4. Design observability, logging, and health checks that support uptime and rapid incident response.
5. Deliver automated test coverage (90%+) across unit, integration, and contract layers including resilience scenarios.
6. Package the service for deployment with repeatable CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation hooks.

## Prerequisites

- Comfortable with Python fundamentals and virtual environment management.
- Working knowledge of HTTP, REST semantics, and JSON serialization.
- Introductory exposure to relational databases and SQL joins.
- Completion of the Non-Technical Starter track or equivalent business context understanding.

## Track Flow

- **Duration:** 40 instructional hours + 10 hours of guided labs.
- **Format:** Instructor-led sessions, lab blocks, and capstone sprints.
- **Capstone:** Ship a secured CRUD API with OpenAPI documentation, background tasks, and observability dashboards.

## Support & Facilitation Notes

- Encourage learners to pair during labs and rotate driver/navigator roles.
- Maintain a visible kanban for blockers, action items, and follow-ups.
- Capture environment pain points to feed into DevOps automation in the BlogCraftAI branch.
