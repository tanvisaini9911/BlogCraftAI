# AI Agents Assessments & Governance

## Workflow Approval Checklist

- [ ] Workflow documented with owner, description, triggers, and data flow diagram.
- [ ] Secrets stored securely; rotation schedule defined.
- [ ] Error handling covers retries, compensation actions, and alerting.
- [ ] Audit logs capture inputs/outputs with correlation IDs.
- [ ] Data retention policy specified and implemented.
- [ ] Security review completed (threat modeling, penetration test findings addressed).

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Tooling | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | pytest + custom mocks | Transformation functions, decision logic |
| Integration | n8n CLI, Postman, pytest | End-to-end workflow execution |
| Failure Simulation | Hoverfly, Chaos Mesh | API timeouts, malformed payloads, rate limits |
| Load | k6, Locust | Burst traffic on webhook triggers |
| Security | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite | Webhook endpoints, credential storage |

### Example pytest Snippet

```python
def test_rss_ingest_handles_timeout(n8n_runner, mocked_rss_feed):
    mocked_rss_feed.set_failure(mode="timeout")
    result = n8n_runner.execute("content_ingest")
    assert result.status == "retry"
    assert "timeout" in result.logs
```

## Incident Response Metrics

- Mean time to detect (MTTD) < 5 minutes using monitoring alerts.
- Mean time to resolve (MTTR) < 30 minutes for SEV-1 automation incidents.
- Post-incident review completed within 48 hours with action items tracked.

## Compliance & Audit Requirements

- Maintain workflow changelog with approvals and deployment history.
- Export audit logs monthly for compliance team review.
- Ensure data processing agreements (DPAs) are in place for third-party integrations.

## Capstone Deliverables

1. Fully automated workflow: ingest content ideas, apply AI scoring, notify editors, and sync to analytics sheet.
2. Automated test suite demonstrating resilience against API timeouts and invalid payloads.
3. Monitoring dashboard (Grafana/DataDog) visualizing throughput, error rate, retry counts.
4. Governance packet: workflow spec, RACI, security assessment, compliance attestation.
